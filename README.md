# IMDb-A-Dynamic-Movie-Database-Powered-by-Flask-and-SQLite
Python -> Flask and SQLite project
In this project, you have created a movie database website using the popular Flask web framework and SQLite database. The site mimics the functionality of IMDB but with a simpler interface. As an administrator, you can add new movies to the site by uploading the movie's poster image, title, plot summary, director's name, four main actors' names, and year of release to the database. The homepage of the site displays a collection of movie images that users can click on to access the movie description page. This page contains all of the movie's relevant details, including the poster image, title, plot summary, director's name, four main actors' names, year of release, and user reviews. The use of Flask and SQLite enables the site to handle complex queries and database transactions, while also ensuring efficient data management and storage.
